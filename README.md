# rock-paper-scissors-bot
Lights up LED to corresponding hand sign in rock-paper-scissors. Deploys computer vision to make decisions, a simple breadboard experiement. The major compnents are 3 LEDs, a raspberry pi pico, a grove vision ai v2 board, as well as the appropriate breadboard and jumper cables. To upload and deploy models on the grove vision ai v2 board please refer to the seed studio guide at the bottom.

The wiring schematic can be used as reference to setup, though any GPIO pins can be used, given they are not power. Ribbon cables(20 or 14 wire) can be used with the grove board with the appropriate adapters. A demo is also linked below.
